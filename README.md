🕵️‍♂️ Use of ANN to Detect Fake Profiles
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to identify whether a Facebook friend request is authentic or a fake profile.
It helps users determine profile authenticity, preventing identity theft and potential data breaches.

⚡ Key Features:
🧠 ANN-Based Detection
A deep neural network analyzes profile parameters to determine the likelihood of a fake account.
🔢 Sigmoid Function
Each neuron uses a Sigmoid function to produce outputs between 0 and 1, representing the probability of a profile being malicious.
👥 Admin and User Modules
Admin Module: Upload profile datasets to train the ANN and view the dataset.
User Module: Input new account data to predict whether the profile is genuine or fake.

🏗️ System Architecture:
The system consists of:
Input Layer: Accepts various profile parameters.
Hidden Layer: Processes patterns to identify fake behaviors.
Output Layer: Provides the probability of a profile being fake.
The model is trained using backpropagation to minimize the error in prediction.

💻 Technical Requirements:
Software:
🖥️ Operating System: Windows
🐍 Language: Python 3.7
🌐 Framework: Django

Hardware:
💾 RAM: 4GB or highe
🖥️ Processor: Intel i3 or higher
💽 Storage: 500GB minimum

🚀 How to Use:
Admin Login:
Use username: admin and password: admin.
Generate ANN Train Model:
Admin uploads a profile dataset to train the model.
Predict Profile Authenticity:
Users can input new account details, and the trained ANN predicts whether the account is fake or genuine.

🔮 Future Enhancements:
1️⃣ Advanced Deep Learning Models
CNNs: Detect fake or stock profile images.
RNNs / LSTMs: Analyze user activity patterns.
Transformers (BERT): Analyze text content for spammy behavior.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Detect suspicious social connections.
2️⃣ Multi-Modal Analysis & Feature Engineering
Analyze images and videos for authenticity.
Conduct textual content analysis on posts/comments.
Extract nuanced behavioral features like friend request speed or activity patterns.
Cross-platform verification for consistency.
3️⃣ Real-World Deployment Enhancements
Real-time Detection: Flag suspicious accounts immediately.
Scalability: Deploy on cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
Federated Learning: Train models without centralizing sensitive data.
Adversarial Robustness: Adapt to evolving fake profile strategies.
